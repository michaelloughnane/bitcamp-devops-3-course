# Dockerfile üê≥

The `Dockerfile` contains a set of instructions that get stored in a `Docker Image`.

We will use a very simple `Dockerfile`. If you'd like, you can [learn more about Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

## Step 3: Add a Dockerfile image

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit the Dockerfile to include the proper image

1. [Edit the `Dockerfile`]({{ repoUrl }}/blob/add-dockerfile/Dockerfile) located on the `add-dockerfile` branch in the root of the repository
2. Paste the following contents inside of the Docker file:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.17
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
```

3. Commit your changes to the `add-dockerfile` branch
