# Using your new Docker Image package

The easiest way to use your Docker Image package is to click the package name from the [package tab]({{ repoUrl }}/packages).

That will bring you to a screen like containing instructions.

**Before we can use this Docker image, you will need to generate a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) that contains the following permissions:**
- repo (all)
- write:packages
- read:packages

We will use this token to log in to Docker, and authenticate with the package.
