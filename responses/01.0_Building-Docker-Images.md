### What is Docker?

Docker is an engine that allows you to run containers. Containers have many advantages, including:

- Code and dependancies are packaged together, so software runs more reliably in different environments
- Containers are a standard unit of software
- As standalone executable packages, containers include everything needed to run the application
- Containers are lightweight in comparison to virtual machines

#### Docker vs Virtual Machines

| Container                                                       | Virtual Machine                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application layer abstraction                                   | Physical layer abstraction                                                               |
| Consume less space than VMs                                     | Include a full copy of the operating system                                              |
| Fast to startup                                                 | Boot up slowly                                                                           |
| Shared OS kernel allows many containers to run on a single host | Multiple virtual machines run on one server at a greater resource cost per guest machine |

#### Dockerfiles, Images, and Container

Before moving forward with the workflow file, let's spend some time on these concepts. There are important differences between *Dockerfiles*, *Images*, and *Containers*.

| Dockerfile                                                                                      | Docker Image                                                                                                                                                         | Docker Container                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text document that contains all the commands and instructions necessary to build a Docker Image. | Executable packages comprised of code, dependancies, libraries, a runtime, environment variables, and configuration files.  Very similar to a virtual machine snapshot. | A runtime instance of a Docker Image.  This is what the image becomes when executed in memory. |

#### What about our workflow?

Our repository contains a `Dockerfile`, source code, and tests for the Tic Tac Toe application.

Our CI Workflow allows us to make code changes. Those changes will trigger an automated build and automated test. But, the automation does not create a deployable artifact.

We will place our application into a Docker container. Then, we will have a _deployable package_.  A deployable package enables CD.

Because a `Dockerfile` is a text file, we are able to version it as source code. This _configuration as code_ allowing us a single point of truth for our application.

As you learned above, we need to turn that _Dockerfile_ into a _Docker image_ if we want to create a runtime instance. We are going to store that image in _GitHub Packages_.
